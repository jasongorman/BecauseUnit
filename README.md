# BecauseUnit
An example implementation of the Roll Your Own Unit Testing Framework" mini-project for SC2016. Published with no warranty.

To use BecauseUnit on your Eclipse or IntelliJ projects, export to a runnable .jar, with Main.main() as the entry point. It requires one command line argument, which is the (relative) folder where the test class files can be found. (e.g., if running in Eclipse for a project, specify "bin" in the arguments).
